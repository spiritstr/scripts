# Scripts
A few scripts the i code in free time.

# Twitch Check Status V1.

A simple way in PHP to show streamers in a page will show the Streamers the you put in the array,with they status,followers and games, i will make a V2 version to include from a DB and a simple way 
to recive new streamers without need to edit the file.

# Twitch Check Status V1.5

Same as V1, but will only show online streamers.

# GMs NA,EU and KR

After twitch api i decided to give a try to the Battle.net API, and it was really good, in under 1h i had all GM ladders.
All the scripts need you to use your own battle.net api key, just google it.
